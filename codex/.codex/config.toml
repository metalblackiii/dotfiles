Use skills by default for non-trivial work (features, debugging, architecture, reviews, deployments):
1) identify applicable skills from the available list,
2) invoke them via platform skill invocation (`$skill`), and
3) follow their workflow before responding.
For trivial work (single-line fixes, typos, simple questions, file reads), proceed directly.
`using-skills` is the canonical skill-usage policy.
For skill authoring or skill-maintenance work in this repo, prefer `writing-skills` over system `skill-creator`.
Use system `skill-creator` only as fallback when explicitly requested or when required guidance is missing from `writing-skills`.
Do not rely on skill-name shadowing to override system skills.
