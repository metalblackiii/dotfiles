# dotfiles

Personal configuration files for AI coding assistants, managed with Git and symlinks.

Currently supports **Codex**, **Claude Code**, and some **Git** configurations. Agent skills live in `codex/.agents/skills/` and agent instructions in `shared/INSTRUCTIONS.md` — both shared across Codex and Claude Code via symlinks.

New here? See [INTRODUCTION.md](INTRODUCTION.md) for the rationale, skill anatomy, and adoption guide.

## Prerequisites

[Codex](https://codex.openai.com/) and/or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) must be installed. The following CLI tools are referenced in permissions and skills:

| Tool | Required | Install | Used by |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| `git` | Yes | Xcode CLT / `brew install git` | Core workflow |
| `gh` | Yes | `brew install gh` | PR creation, issue management |
| `node` / `npm` / `npx` | Yes | `brew install node` or nvm | Running and testing projects |
| `docker` | Optional | [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) or [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) | Container workflows |
| `kubectl` | Optional | `brew install kubectl` | Read-only cluster access |
| `rg` (ripgrep) | Optional | `brew install ripgrep` | Fast shell fallback for text search when built-in tools are unavailable |
| `fd` | Optional | `brew install fd` | Fast shell fallback for file discovery when built-in tools are unavailable |
| `ast-grep` | Optional | `brew install ast-grep` | `ast-grep-patterns` skill (structural code search) |
| `playwright-cli` | Optional | `npm install -g @playwright/cli` | `playwright-cli` skill (browser automation for agents) |
| `jq` | Optional | `brew install jq` | JSON processing in scripts |
| `snyk` | Optional | `brew tap snyk/tap && brew install snyk` | `snyk-expert` skill, vulnerability scanning. Run `snyk auth` after install to authenticate. |
| `codebase-memory-mcp` | Optional | `./setup/install-codebase-memory-mcp.sh` | Knowledge graph MCP for structural code search (v0.3.1 pinned) |
| `rtk` | Optional | `brew install rtk` | Token-optimized CLI proxy (60-90% savings) |

### Optional Security Tooling (Only for `security-reviewer` Scanner Mode)

The security skills work without additional installs. Extra tooling is optional and only used for deeper scan automation.

Scanner-mode tools that use `pip` assume `python3` and `pip` are installed (or use `pipx` equivalents).

| Tool | Required | Install | Used by |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| `gitleaks` | No | `brew install gitleaks` | Secret scanning workflows |
| `semgrep` | No | `pip install semgrep` | Static security pattern scanning |
| `trivy` | No | `brew install trivy` | Dependency/config/container security checks |
| `checkov` | No | `pip install checkov` | IaC security checks |

If these tools are unavailable, `security-reviewer` falls back to manual review and reports which scans were not executed.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metalblackiii/dotfiles.git ~/repos/dotfiles
cd ~/repos/dotfiles

# Install everything
./install.sh

# Or install a single platform
./claude/install.sh
./codex/install.sh
./git/install.sh
```

Original files are backed up with `.backup.TIMESTAMP` before symlinking.

To remove:

```bash
# Uninstall everything
./uninstall.sh

# Or uninstall a single platform
./claude/uninstall.sh
./codex/uninstall.sh
./git/uninstall.sh
```

### What's Shared vs Platform-Specific

| Layer | Shared? | Where |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Instructions (conventions, rules) | Yes | `shared/INSTRUCTIONS.md` — symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` |
| Skills | Yes | `codex/.agents/skills/` — Claude Code accesses via symlink |
| Claude settings, hooks, agents | No | Claude-only features |
| Codex config.toml | No | Codex-only runtime settings |

## Codex Configuration

Codex owns the canonical skill directory (`codex/.agents/skills/`), which is symlinked to `~/.agents/skills/personal` at install time. Its platform-specific file is `config.toml`:

- **Model**: configured per preference (see `config.toml`)
- **Reasoning effort**: configured per preference; valid levels depend on the selected model
- **Approval policy**: `on-request`
- **Sandbox mode**: `workspace-write` with network access enabled (required for `gh` commands, web searches, and API calls)
- **Developer instructions**: `developer_instructions` provides an always-on skills-first reminder for non-trivial work
- **Project docs**: platform-default behavior may load project instruction files (for example `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`); this repo does not configure custom fallback behavior

### Skills (46)

Specialized methodologies that activate automatically when relevant tasks are detected. The `developer_instructions` in `config.toml` enforce "The Iron Law" — check for applicable skills before responding to non-trivial requests.

## Shared Instructions

`shared/INSTRUCTIONS.md` is the single source of truth for agent conventions. It's symlinked as `CLAUDE.md` (for Claude Code) and `AGENTS.md` (for Codex), so both platforms get the same rules:

- **Git preferences** — conventional commits, explicit commit/push approval
- **PR defaults** — reviewers, gh flags
- **Code quality** — preparatory refactoring, Rule of Three, fix broken windows
- **Security** — HIPAA context, no PII in examples, no hardcoded secrets
- **Self-documenting code** — rename over comment, only "why" comments
- **Skill usage** — check skills before non-trivial tasks

## Claude Code Configuration

Claude Code accesses skills via a symlink (`claude/.claude/skills` → `codex/.agents/skills`) and instructions via another (`claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → `shared/INSTRUCTIONS.md`). It adds platform-specific features on top.

### Agents (3)

Custom subagents spawned via the Task tool for parallel or specialized work.

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **analysis-writer** | Produce structured analysis documents for team decision-making |
| **neb-explorer** | Explore feature implementations across neb microservices |
| **upgrade-analyst** | Research dependency upgrades, migrations, and breaking changes |

> **Neb-specific agents**: `neb-explorer` has the neb architecture knowledge (layers, environments, services, shared libraries) inlined directly and assumes neb repositories are cloned into `~/repos/` with their standard names (e.g., `~/repos/neb-ms-billing`, `~/repos/neb-microservice`). If your repos live elsewhere, update the base path in `claude/.claude/agents/neb-explorer.md`.

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **co-research** | Dispatch parallel research agents and Codex, then synthesize findings |

> `prd-loop` and `co-implement` were retired as Claude commands — use the standalone [`prd-loop` CLI](https://github.com/metalblackiii/prd-loop) directly instead.

### Hooks & Scripts

- **session-start.sh** — SessionStart hook. Fires on startup, resume, clear, and compact. Lists all installed skills and enforces skill-first workflow.
- **rtk-rewrite.sh** — PreToolUse hook that transparently rewrites Bash commands through [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) for token savings. Silently no-ops if `rtk` or `jq` aren't installed.
- **guard.sh** + **guard-rules.json** — PreToolUse hook that blocks Bash access to sensitive file paths (env files, secrets, credentials). Rules are externalized to JSON for easy editing.
- **eslint-autofix.sh** — PostToolUse hook that auto-runs ESLint `--fix` after Edit/Write operations on JS/TS files.
- **context-bar.sh** — Status line script showing model, git branch, uncommitted files, sync status, and context usage percentage.


### Permissions

The `settings.json` enforces strict guardrails:

- **Denied**: shell commands with dedicated tool equivalents (`sed`, `awk`, `xargs`), `python -c` inline execution, env/secret files, destructive git operations, dangerous docker flags, package publishing, destructive AWS/CDK/Terraform/Helm/kubectl write operations
- **Ask**: `git commit`, `git push`, `git restore`, `gh pr create/merge/close`, `curl`, `chmod`
- **Allowed**: standard dev tools, read-only kubectl, scoped web access

## Git Configuration

The `git/` directory manages some global Git settings that aren't project-specific.

### Global Gitignore

`git/.gitignore_global` is symlinked to `~/.gitignore_global` and registered via `core.excludesFile`. This is not a Git default — without it, Git has no global ignore file.

To verify it's active:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesFile
# Should output: /Users/<you>/.gitignore_global

readlink ~/.gitignore_global
# Should point to: .../dotfiles/git/.gitignore_global
```

Current global ignores: editor backup files (`*~`), `.DS_Store`, and agent working artifacts (`.co-research/`, `.co-implement/`, `HANDOFF.md`).

## Adding a New Platform

1. Create a directory: `platform-name/`
2. Add `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh`
3. Symlink `platform-name/.config/skills/` → `codex/.agents/skills/`
4. The top-level orchestrator picks up `*/install.sh` automatically

## Customization

If you fork this repo, update these team/environment-specific values:

| What | Where | Default |
|------|-------|---------|
| Neb repo base path | `claude/.claude/agents/neb-explorer.md` | `~/repos/` |
| PR default reviewers | `shared/INSTRUCTIONS.md` → PR Defaults | `Chiropractic-CT-Cloud/phoenix` |
