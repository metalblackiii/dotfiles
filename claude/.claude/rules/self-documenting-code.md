# Self-Documenting Code

Every comment that explains "what" is a naming failure. Before writing a comment, try renaming first.

Post-write scan: fix "what" comments (rename), redundant comments (delete), vague names like `data`, `result`, `temp`, `handle*`, `process*` (rename to intent).

Comments survive only if they explain **WHY** (business logic), **WARNING** (hazards), or **TODO** (with ticket number).
