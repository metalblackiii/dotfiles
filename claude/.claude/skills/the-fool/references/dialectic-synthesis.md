# Dialectic Synthesis

Hegelian dialectic with steel manning for constructing the strongest possible counter-argument and driving toward synthesis.

## Core Principle

The dialectic is not about winning. It is about producing a stronger position than either thesis or antithesis alone. The Fool argues the other side so well that the user must refine their position or acknowledge a genuine trade-off.

## Process

1. **Restate the thesis** — Steelman the user's position first
2. **Construct the antithesis** — Build the strongest opposing argument
3. **Present the clash** — Show where thesis and antithesis genuinely conflict
4. **Drive toward synthesis** — Propose a position that incorporates the best of both

## Steel Manning

Restate the user's position in its strongest possible form before arguing against it.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. Identify the core claim | Strip away weak framing |
| 2. Add the strongest evidence | Supply what the user implied |
| 3. Acknowledge real benefits | Name what's genuinely good |
| 4. Confirm with user | "Is this a fair restatement?" |

**Checklist**: Have I made the position stronger, not weaker? Would the user recognize this as their view (or better)? Am I attacking this version, not an easier one?

## Antithesis Construction

Build the antithesis by asking: "If a smart, informed person disagreed, what would their best argument be?"

| Source of Counter-Arguments | Example |
|----------------------------|---------|
| Opposing trade-off | "Speed now vs. maintainability later" |
| Hidden cost | "The migration cost exceeds the projected savings for 18 months" |
| Alternative that solves the same problem | "A modular monolith gets 80% of the benefit at 20% of the cost" |
| Precedent from similar situations | "Company X tried this and reverted after 2 years" |
| Stakeholder the thesis doesn't serve | "The junior developers will struggle with the added complexity" |

## Synthesis Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conditional** | "X is true when condition A holds; Y is true when condition B holds" |
| **Scope Partitioning** | "Apply X to domain A and Y to domain B" |
| **Temporal** | "Start with X, migrate to Y when trigger Z occurs" |
| **Risk Mitigation** | "Proceed with X but add safeguards from Y" |
| **Hybrid Extraction** | "Take the strongest element from each side" |

## Confidence Assessment

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Synthesis clearly stronger than either side alone | Proceed with synthesis |
| **MEDIUM** | Synthesis is plausible but untested | Identify the riskiest assumption and suggest an experiment |
| **LOW** | Both sides have strong, irreconcilable claims | Name the genuine trade-off; let the user decide based on priorities |
| **PIVOT** | The antithesis is stronger than the thesis | Recommend the user reconsider their original position |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| False synthesis | "Just do both!" without resolving the tension |
| Weak antithesis | Counter-argument is a strawman |
| Thesis bias | Synthesis suspiciously close to original position |
| Complexity creep | Synthesis is more complex than either original |
| Fence-sitting | "It depends" without specifying on what |

## Output Template
